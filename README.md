Have you ever arrived in a city and wondered what to see? ExploreAI is a mobile application that transforms city exploration into an interactive experience. Using real-time location data and AI-powered descriptions, users can discover and unlock landmarks as they physically explore cities.

I started working on this app as a personal project where I wanted to learn more about app development in particular React Native for its cross-platform capabilities. This is the output of my learning. The app is not available on any store yet, although I would like to release it in the future.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Landmark Discovery**: Automatically creates a list of landmarks based on your current city.
- **AI-Powered Descriptions**: Provides dynamic, engaging content about landmarks using GPT-4. Access historical facts, cultural information, and interesting stories
- **Interactive Unlocking System**: Unlock landmark information by physically visiting the location
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your exploration progress across different cities
- **User authentication**: Securely sign up and log in with Clerk. Google Auth is also supported.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Intuitive design with animations and smooth transitions
